#### JavaScript || React || Python || Deep Learning
![JavaScript || React || Python || Deep Learning]
I'm a self-motivated, honest, and hard-working person. I have some skills like C, C++, Python, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Redux, PHP, Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, Neural networks, Computer vision, Image processing, and Graphics design.
My passion is programming and the field of machine learning. So, I want to be a Full-stack web developer.
My strong point is working long hours without losing patience. My weakness is whenever I get any task to do, I give so much time with it until it was finished and it kills some time.
I participated in many programming contests on online and offline platforms

Skills: JavaScript/ React/ MongoDB/ HTML/ CSS/ Python/ Django/ Machine Learning/ Deep Learning/ Computer Vision / Image Processing
